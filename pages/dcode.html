            <p>Entire user card is a Block. One whole structure, one whole component.</p>
            <p>User image and user name are both Elements. They are element because they depend on block to "work" properly. It wouldnot make sence to have either of those outside of block/card.</p>
            <p>Button in this example is actually a block, because it can be used independently  and would make sense to be used outside of a card Block. It does not depend on it. Element depend on block and doesn't make sense outside of a block.
            </p>
            <p>Modifier in this example is a dark theme with white text on Card Block. Modifier make change in visual appearance.</p>
