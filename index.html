        <h2>BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks.</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Block</h3>
        <h4>A functionally independent page component that can be reused. In HTML, blocks are represented by the class attribute.</h4>
        <p>The block name describes its purpose ("What is it?" â€” menu or button)</p>
        <p>The block shouldn't influence its environment, meaning you shouldn't set the external geometry (margin) or positioning for the block.</p>
        <p>You also shouldn't use CSS tag or ID selectors when using BEM.</p>
        <h3>This ensures the necessary independence for reusing blocks or moving them from place to place.</h3>
