            <h2>BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks.</h2>
            <hr>
            <h2>Block</h2>
            <h4>A functionally independent page component that can be reused. In HTML, blocks are represented by the class attribute.</h4>
            <p>The block name describes its purpose ("What is it?" — menu or button)</p>
            <p>The block shouldn't influence its environment, meaning you shouldn't set the external geometry (margin) or positioning for the block.</p>
            <p>You also shouldn't use CSS tag or ID selectors when using BEM.</p>
            <h4>This ensures the necessary independence for reusing blocks or moving them from place to place.</h4>
            <p>A “block” refers to any entity that can stand alone and still make sense. Examples of blocks are header, input, and checkbox.</p>

            <h2>Element</h2>
            <h4>A composite part of a block that can't be used separately from it.</h4>
            <p>The element name describes its purpose</p>
            <p>The structure of an element's full name is block-name__element-name. The element name is separated from the block name with a double underscore (_ _).</p>
            <p>An element is always part of a block, not another element.</p>
            <p>Those parts of a block which have no semantic meaning outside of the block are elements.</p>

            <h2>Modifier</h2>
            <h4>An entity that defines the appearance, state, or behavior of a block or element.</h4>
            <p>The modifier name describes its appearance</p>
            <p>The modifier name is separated from the block or element name by a double dashes (- -).</p>
            <p>A modifier is a flag that changes how a block or an element looks or behaves.</p>
